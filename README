Head Mouse

This program uses a webcam with opencv and dlib to detect the users head pose
in real time, and maps the mouse proportionally.

Requirements:
*dlib
*opencv
*facial landmarks
	http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

Build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
make
make install

Run:
webcam_head_mouse --model shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

Contribution:
I based this code on the dlib example webcam_face_pose_ex.cpp combined with
https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/gazr
